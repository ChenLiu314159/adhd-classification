    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ADHD prediction** remains consistent between a single hold‑out split and 5‑fold cross‑validation (AUC ≈ 0.836), indicating that our current Random Forest + feature engineering pipeline is well‑tuned and not overfitting.  \n",
    "- **Sex prediction** suffers a notable performance decline under cross‑validation (from ≈ 0.75 down to ≈ 0.66), revealing that the existing meta and functional connectivity features do not strongly capture gender-related signals. The earlier hold‑out result likely overestimated true generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explore additional model families**  \n",
    "   - Try XGBoost, LightGBM, or a small neural network; these can sometimes detect subtle patterns that RF might miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhance feature engineering**  \n",
    "   - Introduce higher‑order interactions or ratio features (e.g., ratios of different questionnaire scores).  \n",
    "   - Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA/PLS) to the functional connectivity matrix before modeling.  \n",
    "   - Perform task‑specific feature selection for Sex prediction (e.g., via statistical tests or model feature importances).\n"
